        <h2>Graphic Design Student</h2>

        <p> 
          I am a designer focusing on product design, logos, and image composites. Currently, I am pursuing my associate's in Graphic Design and Marketing at Wake Technical Community College. My favorite type of design work involves highly editing images when an image is the center of a design solution that is where my work stands out.

          I am a designer focusing on product design, logos, and image composites. Currently, I am pursuing my associate's in Graphic Design and Marketing at Wake Technical Community College. My favorite type of design work involves highly editing images when an image is the center of a design solution that is where my work stands out. 
          My goal throughout my designs is not just to make them eye-catching for the target audience but also for them to be universally appealing. Most of my portfolio shows the visual end result of my design but a lot of my time is spent in the sketchbook. The ideation phase is one of my favorite parts of the design process. One of the best feelings is when you come up with a great idea. When you have a solid idea usually the final result is a masterpiece. I hope whoever is reading this enjoyed looking at a glimpse of what I have to offer.
